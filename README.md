# Homework: From UML to SysML
**Topic:** Understanding SysML through comparison with UML  
**Due:** [Insert Date]

## Part 1: Conceptual Questions

Answer briefly

1. **Purpose and Motivation**  
   Why was SysML created? What limitations of UML does it address?

2. **Modeling Perspective**  
   UML is based on object-oriented concepts, especially the UML Class diagram. How does SysML’s *block-based* approach differ conceptually from UML’s *class-based* approach?

3. **Scope**  
   What kinds of system elements can be represented in SysML that are not typically modeled in UML?

4. **Focus**  
   Give an example (maybe from your own experiences as a developer/student?) of a system where using UML alone would be insufficient, and explain how SysML can better represent it.

## Part 2: Diagrams

1. Make a **comparison table** comparing UML diagrams and SysML diagrams.  
   - Indicate whether each is *reused*, *modified*, or *new* in SysML.  
   - For each SysML-specific diagram, write one short sentence about its purpose.

2. Explain briefly:
   - What is the **Block Definition Diagram (BDD)**?  
   - What are the main differences to the UML **Class Diagram**?

3. What is a **Parametric Diagram** in SysML?  
   How does it enhance system analysis compared to UML?

## Part 3: Examples

1. Create a BDD diagram focusing on the hardware components of a [Tetris Cabinet](https://www.arcade-museum.com/Videogame/tetris) (try to think of everyting).
2. Create a UML Component diagram for the same [Tetris Cabinet](https://www.arcade-museum.com/Videogame/tetris).
